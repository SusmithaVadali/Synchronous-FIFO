<h1>Overview</h1>
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory buffer using Verilog. A FIFO is a sequential storage structure that allows data to be written and read in the same order, making it ideal for applications that require ordered data flow.

In this synchronous version, both read and write operations are controlled by a single clock signal, ensuring synchronized data transfer. The design also includes necessary control logic to handle full and empty conditions, preventing overflow and underflow errors.
