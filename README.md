This project implements a Synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer using digital design principles. A FIFO is a memory structure where data is written and read in the order it was inserted, making it useful in various digital systems for temporary data storage and flow control.

This FIFO is synchronous, meaning all operations (write and read) are triggered by a common clock.
